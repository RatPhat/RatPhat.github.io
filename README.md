## Personal website documentation


### July 5-7

I have experimented and found some cool new things like how I can use css to style the icons for different social links in different ways. I have even implemented animation by using calc to have different orders of animation by multiplying the order number with *100ms* to create a wave effect. During these days I have even changed from normal css and **HTML** to using **bootstrap** and **SASS**, I am really enjoying **SASS** but I have plans to change from **bootstrap** to **React** to make a more dynamic website. 

>To be honest I have no idea how I am supposed to doccument and I am sure different comapnies have different ways of doing things but this is good practice since I do not do this very often, I do not expect anyone to read this but it is good for me to look back and see the changes I have done. I have also changed some colors and fonts and now it looks more rich, classy and modern which I really enjoy. As of writing this I see that I <need to learn markdown more since I have no idea what I am actually doing.
